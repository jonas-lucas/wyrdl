## How to Create a Wordlist

To create the `wordlist.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command:

```shell
python create_wordlist.py <file_path>
```

Replace `<file_path>` with the path to the file that contains the words you want to extract and save in the `wordlist.txt` file.

5. After executing the command, the script will process the file and create the `wordlist.txt` file in the same directory.
